# ****Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dataset****
## **Introduction**
This dataset contains information on airline passengers and their satisfaction ratings. It includes details such as the passenger's frequent flyer program (FFP) information, their age and gender, and their ratings of various aspects of their airline experience. The dataset has a range index of 0 to 62987.

## **Problem Statement**
The airline industry is highly competitive, and airlines need to continually improve the customer experience in order to attract and retain passengers. One way to do this is to understand what factors contribute to passenger satisfaction, and to identify areas where the airline can improve. The goal of this analysis is to explore the dataset and identify patterns in passenger behavior and satisfaction, with the aim of improving the airline's customer experience.

## **Data Description**
The dataset contains the following variables:

MEMBER_NO: A unique identifier for each passenger
FFP_DATE: The date the passenger joined the airline's frequent flyer program
FIRST_FLIGHT_DATE: The date of the passenger's first flight with the airline
GENDER: The passenger's gender (M/F)
FFP_TIER: The passenger's frequent flyer program tier (1-6)
WORK_CITY: The city where the passenger works
WORK_PROVINCE: The province/state where the passenger works
WORK_COUNTRY: The country where the passenger works
AGE: The passenger's age
LOAD_TIME: The date the data was loaded into the system
FLIGHT_COUNT: Member flight count.
BP_SUM: Flight plan.
SUM_YR_1: Fare revenue.
SUM_YR_2: Votes price.
SEG_KM_SUM: Total flight distances.
LAST_FLIGHT_DATE: Member last flight date
LAST_TO_END: The time from the last flight to the end of the observation window.
AVG_INTERVAL: average flight time interval.
MAX_INTERVAL: Maximum flight interval.
EXCHANGE_COUNT: Number of points exchanged.
avg_discount: Average discount rate.
Points_Sum: The total number of points the passenger has accumulated in their frequent flyer program
Point_NotFlight: The number of points the passenger has accumulated through non-flight activities (e.g. credit card purchases)

## **Usage**
This dataset can be used for various analytical purposes, such as predictive modeling, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis. For example, you could use this dataset to predict passenger satisfaction or to identify patterns in passenger behavior.
